# CC:Tweaked Resource API

This project aims to add a simple but very flexible API to CC:Tweaked that allows access to resources via the Lua API.  
The API is "read-only"â€”you can only retrieve information, but you can't modify it.

> [!CAUTION]
> v1.1 1.18.2 & 1.19.4 releases hava a major flaw  
> **These releases have a major flaw and do not have the correct version vanilla resourcepack bundled  
> Content added newer then 1.16.5 will not be accessable trough the API**

### v1.0 
This version allows access to textures, models, blockstate models, and recipes.

### v1.1
This version adds item textures and models, along with improved texture handling APIs like pixel and collor from raw PNG data.

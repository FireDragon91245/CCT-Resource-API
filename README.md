# CC:Tweaked Resource API

This project aims to add a simple but very flexible API to CC:Tweaked that allows access to resources via the Lua API.  
The API is "read-only"â€”you can only retrieve information, but you can't modify it.

### v1.0 
This version allows access to textures, models, blockstate models, and recipes.

### v1.1
This version adds item textures and models, along with improved texture handling APIs like pixel and collor from raw PNG data.
